# cs430-final
Yasaman Mostafavi and Andrea Ocampo's final project related to writing a Huffman Code algorithm for IIT's CS 430

Report
Each iteration is O(logn) to determine correct weight, then there are O(n) iterations so total runtime is O(nlogn) for this algorithm

This code was written and tested in Python 3.9 on both Windows and Mac OS.
